# Lab: Secure Pod Deployment

## Overview
This lab guides you through implementing secure pod deployments in Kubernetes, following best practices for financial services workloads with appropriate security contexts, policies, and configurations.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement pod security contexts
- Configure pod security policies (or alternatives in newer K8s versions)
- Apply container security best practices
- Implement network policies for pod isolation
- Secure pod-to-pod and pod-to-service communication

## Prerequisites
- Functioning Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured correctly
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes security concepts

## Lab Tasks
1. Creating Pods with Security Contexts
2. Implementing Pod Security Standards:
   - Baseline
   - Restricted
   - Privileged (for comparison)
3. Resource Limits and Requests Configuration
4. Network Policy Implementation
5. Secret Management for Pods
6. Service Account Configuration
7. Security Context Constraint Implementation
8. Validating Pod Security with Audit Tools

## Financial Services Considerations
- Regulatory requirements for workload isolation
- Data protection requirements
- Principle of least privilege implementation
- Audit requirements for container execution

## Validation Tests
- Security context verification
- Policy enforcement testing
- Resource constraint validation
- Network policy effectiveness testing

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual YAML manifests for secure pod configurations
3. Add diagrams showing security layers for pods
4. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
5. Add command outputs showing security validation
6. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
