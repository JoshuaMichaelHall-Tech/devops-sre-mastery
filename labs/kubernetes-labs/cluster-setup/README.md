# Lab: Kubernetes Cluster Setup

## Overview
This lab guides you through setting up a Kubernetes cluster suitable for financial services applications, with proper security configurations and essential components.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster using different methods (Minikube, Kind, or cloud provider)
- Configure cluster networking and security
- Install and configure essential add-ons
- Prepare the cluster for financial services workloads
- Understand cluster architecture and components

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed locally
- kubectl command-line tool
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Sufficient local resources (CPU, RAM) or cloud account

## Lab Tasks
1. Local Development Cluster Setup (Choose one):
   - Minikube Installation and Configuration
   - Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) Setup
   - K3d Setup
2. Cluster Verification and Exploration
3. Namespace Configuration
4. RBAC Initial Setup
5. Installing Essential Add-ons:
   - Metrics Server
   - Kubernetes Dashboard
   - Prometheus/Grafana (Basic)
6. Exploring Cluster Components and Architecture

## Financial Services Considerations
- Cluster security baseline for financial workloads
- Isolation requirements for financial data
- Auditing and logging considerations
- Development vs. production cluster differences

## Validation Tests
- Cluster health verification
- Add-on functionality testing
- Basic workload deployment
- Security assessment

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual installation commands and YAML manifests
3. Add architecture diagram showing the cluster components
4. Include specific financial services security requirements
5. Add screenshots of expected command outputs
6. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
