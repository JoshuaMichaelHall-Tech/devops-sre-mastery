# Lab: Service Mesh Implementation

## Overview
This lab guides you through implementing a service mesh (Istio) for microservices in Kubernetes, with a focus on security, observability, and traffic management features essential for financial services applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Install and configure a service mesh
- Implement mutual TLS authentication between services
- Configure traffic management (routing, load balancing)
- Set up observability and monitoring
- Apply financial services security patterns

## Prerequisites
- Functioning Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured correctly
- Helm installed (optional)
- Basic understanding of microservices architecture

## Lab Tasks
1. Service Mesh Installation and Configuration
2. Deploying Sample Microservices Application
3. Implementing Mutual TLS Authentication
4. Configuring Traffic Management:
   - Request Routing
   - Traffic Splitting
   - Fault Injection
5. Setting Up Observability:
   - Distributed Tracing
   - Metrics Collection
   - Visualization
6. Implementing Security Policies
7. Performance Testing and Optimization

## Financial Services Considerations
- Secure service-to-service communication
- Request tracing for audit requirements
- Traffic management for resilience
- Observability for compliance verification

## Validation Tests
- mTLS verification
- Traffic routing verification
- Observability validation
- Security policy enforcement testing

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual YAML manifests for service mesh configuration
3. Add architecture diagram showing the service mesh components
4. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
5. Add screenshots of observability dashboards
6. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
