# Lab: ECS Microservices Deployment

## Overview
This lab guides you through deploying a containerized microservices application on Amazon ECS with appropriate security, monitoring, and high availability configurations for financial services workloads.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement a secure ECS cluster
- Deploy containerized microservices with appropriate task definitions
- Configure service discovery and load balancing
- Implement monitoring and logging for containerized applications
- Apply security best practices for container deployments

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured locally
- Docker installed locally
- Understanding of containerization basics

## Lab Tasks
1. ECS Cluster Creation (Fargate mode)
2. Container Image Creation and ECR Repository Setup
3. Task Definition Configuration with Security Best Practices
4. Service Definition with Auto Scaling
5. Application Load Balancer Configuration
6. Service Discovery Implementation
7. CloudWatch Monitoring and Logging Setup
8. Security Group Configuration

## Financial Services Considerations
- Container image security scanning
- Secret management for containerized applications
- Compliance requirements for container deployments
- Audit trail for container operations

## Validation Tests
- Service deployment verification
- High availability testing
- Security control validation
- Performance testing

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include sample Dockerfiles and container configuration
3. Add ECS task and service definition JSON/YAML
4. Create architecture diagram showing the deployment
5. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
6. Add screenshots of expected AWS Console views
7. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
