# Lab: RDS High-Availability Implementation

## Overview
This lab guides you through creating a highly available RDS database deployment suitable for financial services applications, with proper security, backup, and disaster recovery configurations.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement a multi-AZ RDS deployment
- Configure appropriate security settings for database access
- Implement automated backup and point-in-time recovery
- Set up monitoring and alerting for database performance
- Apply financial services best practices to database architecture

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured locally
- Terraform installed (optional, for IaC implementation)
- Basic understanding of relational databases

## Lab Tasks
1. RDS Instance Creation with Multi-AZ
2. Security Group Configuration for Database Access
3. Parameter Group Configuration for Security Best Practices
4. Encryption Configuration (At-rest and In-transit)
5. Automated Backup Configuration
6. Read Replica Implementation
7. CloudWatch Monitoring and Alerting Setup
8. Database Event Subscription

## Financial Services Considerations
- Data protection requirements for financial information
- Backup and recovery for compliance
- Audit logging for database operations
- Performance considerations for financial transactions

## Validation Tests
- High availability testing (failover)
- Backup and restore validation
- Security control verification
- Performance benchmarking

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual Terraform code or CloudFormation templates
3. Add architecture diagram showing the high-availability design
4. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
5. Add screenshots of expected AWS Console views
6. Create SQL scripts for testing database functionality
7. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
