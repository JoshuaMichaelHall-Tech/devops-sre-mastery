# Lab: Terraform Multi-Environment Infrastructure

## Overview
This lab guides you through implementing a multi-environment infrastructure using Terraform, with proper separation between development, testing, and production environments suitable for financial services applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Design multi-environment architecture with Terraform
- Implement environment separation strategies
- Create environment-specific configurations
- Apply environment-appropriate security controls
- Implement proper state management for multiple environments

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed locally
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state management
- Basic understanding of Terraform concepts

## Lab Tasks
1. Repository Structure Setup for Multiple Environments
2. Backend Configuration for Environment Separation
3. Creating Environment-Specific Variables
4. Implementing Shared Modules
5. Environment-Specific Security Controls
6. Creating Deployment Workflow
7. Environment Promotion Strategy
8. Documentation and Diagramming

## Financial Services Considerations
- Regulatory requirements for environment separation
- Appropriate security controls per environment
- Audit trail for infrastructure changes
- Environment-specific compliance requirements

## Validation Tests
- Environment isolation verification
- Security control validation
- State management verification
- Cross-environment testing

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual Terraform code for environment configurations
3. Add architecture diagram showing multi-environment setup
4. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
5. Add deployment workflow diagrams
6. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
