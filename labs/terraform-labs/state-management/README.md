# Lab: Terraform State Management

## Overview
This lab guides you through implementing proper Terraform state management for enterprise and financial services environments, with a focus on security, collaboration, and disaster recovery.

## Learning Objectives
- Configure remote state storage with appropriate security
- Implement state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Manage sensitive data in state files
- Create state backup and recovery procedures
- Apply state management best practices for team environments

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed locally
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of Terraform concepts
- Git for version control

## Lab Tasks
1. Remote Backend Configuration:
   - S3 Bucket Setup with Appropriate Security
   - DynamoDB Table for State Locking
2. State Security Implementation:
   - Encryption Configuration
   - Access Control
   - Sensitive Data Handling
3. State Operations:
   - Import and Move Resources
   - State Locking Demonstration
   - Handling State Conflicts
4. Backup and Disaster Recovery:
   - State Versioning
   - Backup Procedures
   - Recovery Testing
5. Team Collaboration Workflows

## Financial Services Considerations
- Security requirements for infrastructure state
- Audit requirements for state changes
- Disaster recovery for compliance
- Access control for separation of duties

## Validation Tests
- State security verification
- Locking mechanism testing
- Backup and recovery validation
- Team workflow testing

## Cleanup Instructions
- Resources to remove after lab completion
- Verification steps for complete cleanup

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed step-by-step instructions for each lab task
2. Include actual Terraform code for backend configuration
3. Add diagrams showing state workflow
4. Include specific financial services compliance requirements
5. Add team workflow diagrams
6. Create validation scripts to verify successful implementation
