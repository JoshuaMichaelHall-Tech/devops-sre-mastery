# Security Automation Suite for Financial Services

## Business Purpose

This project implements an automated security and compliance toolchain for financial services environments, ensuring continuous compliance monitoring, security validation, and evidence generation for regulatory requirements. It demonstrates how DevOps security practices can be applied to highly regulated financial environments.

## Business Value

- **Audit Preparation**: Reduce audit preparation time from weeks to hours
- **Compliance Assurance**: Continuously validate infrastructure against regulatory requirements
- **Risk Reduction**: Identify and remediate security issues before they impact production
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate manual security processes
- **Regulatory Evidence**: Automatically generate evidence for auditors and regulators

## Architecture

### Core Functionality

The security automation suite integrates multiple security and compliance tools into a cohesive workflow:

1. **Security Scanning Layer**: Automated tools that scan infrastructure, containers, and applications
2. **Policy Enforcement Layer**: Automated validation against security policies and compliance frameworks
3. **Remediation Layer**: Automated or guided remediation for identified issues
4. **Evidence Collection Layer**: Automated collection and storage of compliance evidence
5. **Reporting Layer**: Dashboards and reports for security posture and compliance status

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Infrastructure Security Scanning
- Terraform security scanning with tfsec and checkov
- AWS environment scanning with AWS Security Hub
- Periodic vulnerability scanning with Nessus
- Custom financial services compliance checks

#### 2. Container Security
- Container image scanning with Trivy and Clair
- Container runtime security with Falco
- Image signing and verification workflow
- Registry security implementation

#### 3. Compliance Automation
- Automated controls for SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and FINRA
- Compliance evidence collection and storage
- Remediation workflow for compliance gaps
- Automated compliance reporting

#### 4. Secret Management
- Secret rotation automation with HashiCorp Vault
- Integration with AWS Secrets Manager
- Access audit logging
- Emergency access workflow

#### 5. CI/CD Security Integration
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Build-time security scanning
- Deployment-time validation
- Runtime security monitoring

## Financial Services Considerations

### Regulatory Framework Implementation

- **SOX Controls**:
  - Change management workflow
  - Segregation of duties enforcement
  - Audit trail implementation
  - Evidence collection automation

- **PCI-DSS Requirements**:
  - Cardholder data environment segregation
  - Vulnerability management program
  - Access control implementation
  - Regular security testing

- **GDPR Compliance**:
  - Data classification automation
  - Access control validation
  - Data protection verification
  - Right to be forgotten implementation

### Security Architecture

- **Defense in Depth**:
  - Multiple security layers at infrastructure, container, and application levels
  - Overlapping controls for critical assets
  - Compensating controls where needed

- **Least Privilege Implementation**:
  - IAM role right-sizing
  - Permission boundary enforcement
  - Just-in-time access mechanisms
  - Regular access reviews

- **Security Monitoring**:
  - Real-time security event monitoring
  - Behavioral anomaly detection
  - Threat intelligence integration
  - Incident response automation

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Security Engineering**:
  - Security tooling implementation
  - Policy as code development
  - Vulnerability management

- **DevSecOps Practices**:
  - Security integration in CI/CD
  - Automated security testing
  - Shift-left security implementation

- **Compliance Automation**:
  - Control mapping to technical implementations
  - Evidence collection automation
  - Compliance reporting

- **Cloud Security**:
  - AWS security service configuration
  - Multi-account security management
  - Cloud-native security controls

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrator access
- Terraform v1.0+ installed
- Docker installed
- GitHub account for CI/CD
- Access to security scanning tools (Trivy, tfsec, etc.)

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall/security-automation.git
   cd security-automation
   ```

2. Configure AWS Security Hub
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -target=module.security_hub
   ```

3. Deploy scanning infrastructure
   ```bash
   terraform apply -target=module.scanning_infrastructure
   ```

4. Configure CI/CD integration
   ```bash
   cp .github/workflows/* /path/to/your/project/.github/workflows/
   ```

5. Setup compliance reporting
   ```bash
   terraform apply -target=module.compliance_reporting
   ```

6. Verify deployment
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
   ```

## Usage Examples

### On-Demand Security Scanning

```bash
# Scan infrastructure
./scripts/scan-infrastructure.sh --environment prod

# Scan container images
./scripts/scan-containers.sh --image-name api-service --tag latest

# Generate compliance report
./scripts/generate-compliance-report.sh --framework pci-dss
```

### CI/CD Integration

Example GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run Security Scan
        uses: ./actions/security-scan
        with:
          scan-type: full
          environment: dev
```
