# Infrastructure as Code for Multi-Environment Deployment

## Business Purpose

This project implements a secure, compliant infrastructure for financial services applications across development, testing, and production environments using Terraform and AWS. It demonstrates the application of Infrastructure as Code principles to create reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure that meets financial services security and compliance requirements.

## Business Value

- **Cost Optimization**: Environment standardization reduces resource waste by 30-40%
- **Deployment Efficiency**: Infrastructure deployment time reduced from days to minutes
- **Risk Reduction**: Security and compliance controls are built-in and consistent
- **Operational Excellence**: Standardized environments reduce configuration drift
- **Audit Readiness**: Infrastructure documentation and state tracking enables faster audits

## Architecture

### Environment Separation

This project implements a true multi-environment architecture with complete separation:

- **Development Environment**: Used for feature development and testing
- **Test/QA Environment**: Used for integration testing and QA validation
- **Production Environment**: Hosts the live application with enhanced security

Each environment has isolated:
- Network boundaries (separate VPCs)
- Security controls (environment-specific security groups)
- IAM permissions (role-based access control)
- Data storage (separate database instances)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Network Infrastructure**
   - VPC with public and private subnets
   - Security groups and NACLs
   - VPN and Transit Gateway configuration

2. **Compute Resources**
   - EC2 instances with Auto Scaling Groups
   - ECS/EKS clusters for containerized workloads
   - Lambda functions for serverless components

3. **Database Infrastructure**
   - RDS instances with proper security groups
   - Multi-AZ configuration for high availability
   - Backup and restore automation

4. **Security Implementation**
   - IAM roles and policies with least privilege
   - KMS for encryption key management
   - AWS Security Hub integration
   - CloudTrail for audit logging

5. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
   - SNS for notifications
   - X-Ray for distributed tracing

### Terraform Implementation

- **Module Structure**: Reusable modules for each core component
- **State Management**: Remote state with S3 backend and DynamoDB locking
- **Variable Handling**: Environment-specific variable files
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment

## Financial Services Considerations

### Compliance Controls

- **SOX Compliance**:
  - Proper segregation of duties through IAM
  - Audit logging for all infrastructure changes
  - Access control documentation

- **PCI-DSS Requirements**:
  - Network segmentation for cardholder data
  - Encryption of data in transit and at rest
  - Regular vulnerability scanning

- **GDPR Considerations**:
  - Data storage location controls
  - Data lifecycle management
  - Access control and logging

### Security Implementation

- **Defense in Depth**:
  - Multiple security layers including NACLs, security groups, and IAM
  - Private subnets for sensitive workloads
  - Bastion hosts for secure access

- **Encryption Strategy**:
  - KMS for key management
  - TLS for all communications
  - Encrypted EBS volumes and S3 buckets

- **Automated Security Validation**:
  - Checkov for IaC security scanning
  - AWS Config for compliance monitoring
  - Regular security assessment automation

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Terraform Expertise**:
  - Module development and reuse
  - State management
  - Dynamic resource creation

- **AWS Architecture**:
  - VPC design and implementation
  - Security service configuration
  - High-availability patterns

- **Security Engineering**:
  - Defense-in-depth implementation
  - Compliance controls automation
  - Least privilege implementation

- **DevOps Practices**:
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - CI/CD for infrastructure
  - Automated testing

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform v1.0+ installed
- AWS CLI configured
- S3 bucket for Terraform state
- DynamoDB table for state locking

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall/infrastructure-multi-env.git
   cd infrastructure-multi-env
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform
   ```bash
   terraform init -backend-config=environments/dev/backend.tfvars
   ```

3. Plan deployment
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev/terraform.tfvars -out=tfplan
   ```

4. Apply changes
   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```

5. Verify deployment
   ```bash
   terraform output
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=dev"
   ```
