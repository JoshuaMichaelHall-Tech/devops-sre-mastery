# Multi-Environment AWS Infrastructure for Financial Services

## Business Purpose

This project implements a production-grade, multi-environment infrastructure for financial services applications using Terraform and AWS. It demonstrates infrastructure as code principles to create secure, compliant, and scalable environments that meet rigorous financial industry requirements while enabling rapid development and deployment.

## Business Value

- **Cost Optimization**: Environment standardization reduces resource waste by 30-40%
- **Deployment Efficiency**: Infrastructure deployment time reduced from days to minutes
- **Risk Reduction**: Standardized security and compliance controls minimize vulnerabilities
- **Operational Excellence**: Version-controlled infrastructure eliminates configuration drift
- **Audit Readiness**: Comprehensive infrastructure documentation streamlines compliance audits
- **Time-to-Market**: Accelerated development through environment parity
- **Innovation Enablement**: Self-service infrastructure for development teams

## Architecture

![Multi-Environment Infrastructure Architecture](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

### Environment Separation

This project implements a true multi-environment architecture with complete separation:

- **Development Environment**: For feature development and rapid iteration
- **Test/QA Environment**: For integration testing and compliance validation
- **Staging Environment**: Production-identical environment for final verification
- **Production Environment**: Hosts the live application with enhanced security and scaling

Each environment has isolated:
- Network boundaries (separate VPCs with controlled inter-VPC communication)
- Security controls (defense-in-depth with environment-specific policies)
- IAM permissions (granular role-based access control)
- Data storage (separate database instances with appropriate controls)
- Monitoring and alerting (environment-specific thresholds and responses)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Network Infrastructure
- Multi-AZ VPC design with public, private, and restricted subnets
- Transit Gateway for controlled cross-environment access
- VPN and Direct Connect for secure corporate network integration
- Advanced network security with NACLs, security groups, and AWS Network Firewall
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for API and web protection

#### 2. Compute Resources
- Auto Scaling Groups with environment-specific scaling policies
- EKS clusters for containerized microservices with proper node isolation
- Spot Instance integration for cost optimization in non-production
- Reserved Instances strategy for production workloads
- Lambda functions for event-driven processing with appropriate security contexts

#### 3. Database and Storage
- Multi-AZ RDS instances with read replicas for high performance
- Aurora Serverless for development environments to optimize costs
- S3 buckets with appropriate encryption and access policies
- DynamoDB tables with autoscaling for transactional workloads
- ElastiCache for Redis with encryption for session management
- Backup strategy aligned with regulatory requirements

#### 4. Security Implementation
- AWS Identity Center (SSO) integration for access management
- IAM roles and policies following least privilege principles
- KMS for encryption key management with automatic rotation
- AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty for threat detection
- CloudTrail and Config for comprehensive audit logging
- Secrets Manager for secure credentials handling

#### 5. Compliance Automation
- AWS Config Rules mapped to compliance frameworks
- Automated remediation for policy violations
- Continuous compliance scanning and reporting
- Evidence collection for audit purposes
- Tagging strategy for cost allocation and compliance tracking

#### 6. Observability Stack
- CloudWatch with custom dashboards for each environment
- Container Insights for Kubernetes monitoring
- X-Ray for distributed transaction tracing
- Centralized logging with OpenSearch for advanced log analytics
- Automated alerting with escalation paths

### Terraform Implementation

- **Module Architecture**: Reusable modules for consistent deployment across environments
- **State Management**: Remote state with S3 backend, DynamoDB locking, and proper security controls
- **CI/CD Integration**: Infrastructure deployment through secure pipelines
- **Testing Framework**: Automated testing of infrastructure with Terratest
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated architecture diagrams and documentation

## Financial Services Specialization

### Regulatory Compliance

- **SOX Controls**:
  - Comprehensive change management with approval workflows

- **PCI-DSS Implementation**:
  - Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) isolation with strict boundary controls
  - End-to-end encryption for payment data
  - Vulnerability management program with automated scanning
  - File integrity monitoring for critical systems

- **GDPR and Data Privacy**:
  - Data classification and handling mechanisms
  - Region-specific deployment options for data sovereignty
  - Automated data lifecycle management
  - Privacy-by-design infrastructure components

### Financial Services Security Features

- **Defense in Depth Strategy**:
  - Multiple security layers at network, compute, and data tiers
  - Overlapping controls to prevent single points of failure
  - Advanced DDoS protection for public-facing services
  - Real-time threat monitoring and response

- **High Availability Design**:
  - 99.99% availability target for production environment
  - Multi-region disaster recovery capability
  - Active-active database configuration
  - Automated failover testing

- **Fraud Prevention Infrastructure**:
  - Real-time transaction monitoring integration points
  - Secure API infrastructure for third-party validation
  - Anomaly detection framework infrastructure
  - Secure event processing for fraud signals

## Business Impact Examples

### Cost Optimization

- Development environment auto-shutdown during non-business hours saves $45,000 annually
- Spot Instance usage in non-production reduces compute costs by 60-70%
- Resource right-sizing based on CloudWatch metrics saves $30,000 annually
