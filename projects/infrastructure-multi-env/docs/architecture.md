# Infrastructure Multi-Environment Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Infrastructure Multi-Environment project, which implements a secure, compliant infrastructure for financial services applications across development, testing, and production environments.

## Design Principles

This architecture is built on the following principles:

1. **Complete Environment Separation**: Development, testing, and production environments are fully isolated to prevent cross-environment impact
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect resources at every level
3. **Least Privilege**: All components operate with minimal required permissions
4. **Automation First**: All infrastructure is deployed and managed through code
5. **Compliance by Design**: Regulatory requirements are built into the architecture

## Architecture Components

### 1. Network Architecture

#### VPC Design
Each environment (dev, test, prod) has its own dedicated VPC with no direct connectivity between them. Each VPC has:

- **Public Subnets**: For internet-facing components like load balancers
- **Private Application Subnets**: For application servers with no direct internet access
- **Private Data Subnets**: For databases with no direct internet access
- **Transit Subnets**: For VPN and hybrid connectivity

#### Network Security
- **Security Groups**: Granular traffic control at the resource level
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level traffic control as secondary defense
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Comprehensive network traffic logging for audit
- **Transit Gateway**: Centralized connectivity management with security controls
- **AWS Network Firewall**: Additional layer of network protection

### 2. Compute Architecture

#### EC2 Instances
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Dynamic scaling based on demand
- **Launch Templates**: Standardized, hardened configurations
- **Instance Profiles**: Secure IAM role assignment
- **Systems Manager**: Centralized management and patching

#### Containers
- **ECS/EKS**: Managed container orchestration
- **ECR**: Secure container registry with vulnerability scanning
- **Fargate**: Serverless container execution

### 3. Database Architecture

#### RDS Deployments
- **Multi-AZ Configuration**: High availability for all environments
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Parameter Groups**: Hardened security configurations
- **Subnet Groups**: Database isolation in private subnets

#### DynamoDB
- **On-Demand Capacity**: Automatic scaling
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Continuous backup
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with KMS

### 4. Security Architecture

#### Identity and Access Management
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for all components
- **Service Control Policies**: Organization-wide guardrails
- **Permission Boundaries**: Maximum permission limits
- **Identity Federation**: Integration with corporate identity

#### Data Protection
- **KMS**: Centralized key management
- **S3 Bucket Policies**: Strict access controls
- **Macie**: Sensitive data discovery
- **CloudHSM**: Hardware security modules for financial data

#### Security Monitoring
- **Security Hub**: Centralized security monitoring
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection
- **Config**: Configuration compliance
- **CloudTrail**: API activity auditing

### 5. Compliance Controls

#### Audit Logging
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized log management
- **S3 Logging**: Object-level logging
- **RDS Logging**: Database activity monitoring
- **CloudTrail**: Comprehensive API activity logs

#### Automated Compliance
- **Config Rules**: Automated compliance checking
- **Lambda Remediations**: Automated fixing of compliance issues
- **Evidently**: Compliance evidence collection
- **Security Hub Standards**: PCI-DSS, CIS benchmarks

## Environment Separation Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **Security Level**: Standard controls with development flexibility
- **Data Classification**: No production or sensitive customer data
- **Access Controls**: Broader team access with logging

### Test/QA Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and QA validation
- **Security Level**: Enhanced controls mirroring production
- **Data Classification**: Anonymized data for testing
- **Access Controls**: Limited team access with approval process

### Production Environment
- **Security Level**: Maximum security controls
- **Data Classification**: Real customer financial data
- **Access Controls**: Extremely limited, just-in-time access with approval
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced detection and alerting

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Primary IaC tool for all environment deployment
- **Module Structure**: Reusable modules for consistency
- **State Management**: Remote state with locking
- **Provider Authentication**: Secure authentication using roles

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Automated testing and security scanning
- **Approval Workflows**: Required approvals for environment changes
- **Drift Detection**: Automated checking for unauthorized changes
- **Rollback Capability**: Safe reversal of problematic changes

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add detailed network diagrams for each environment
2. Include security groups and network ACL specifications
3. Add IAM role and policy details for each component
4. Include compliance mapping to specific regulations
5. Add performance considerations for financial workloads
