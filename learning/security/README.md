# Security Learning Path for Financial Services DevOps/SRE

## Overview
This directory documents my journey learning security practices essential for DevOps/SRE roles in financial services environments, with a focus on implementing security as code and automation.

## Learning Philosophy
> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This learning path follows a structured approach:
- Start with security fundamentals and mindset
- Focus on practical implementation of security controls
- Emphasize automation and "security as code"
- Apply financial services regulatory requirements
- Demonstrate business value and risk reduction metrics

## Security Topics Covered

### Foundation
- **Security Fundamentals**: Core principles and concepts
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying and prioritizing threats
- **Security Architecture**: Defense-in-depth strategies
- **Secure Development**: Secure coding practices
- **Vulnerability Management**: Scanning, prioritization, remediation

### Infrastructure & Cloud Security
- **AWS Security**: Service-specific security controls
- **Infrastructure as Code Security**: Securing Terraform and CloudFormation
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, NACLs, VPCs, TLS
- **Identity & Access Management**: Zero trust implementation
- **Secrets Management**: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, key management

### Application & Container Security
- **Container Security**: Image scanning, runtime protection
- **Kubernetes Security**: RBAC, network policies, admission control
- **API Security**: Gateway protection, authentication, authorization
- **SAST/DAST**: Code and application scanning
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, tokenization, masking

### Compliance & Governance
- **Financial Services Regulations**: SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR
- **Compliance as Code**: Automated compliance verification
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for investigations
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated evidence for audits
- **Security Policies**: Implementation and enforcement

### DevSecOps Implementation
- **Pipeline Security**: CI/CD security integration
- **Security Testing Automation**: Automated security validation
- **Incident Response**: Detection and remediation automation
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Security Metrics**: Measuring security effectiveness

## Business Impact
This learning path emphasizes demonstrating business value through:
- **Risk Reduction**: Quantifiable security posture improvements
- **Compliance Efficiency**: Automated controls and evidence collection
- **Incident Response**: Reduced time to detect and remediate
- **Developer Velocity**: Security integration without slowing delivery
- **Audit Readiness**: Continuous compliance validation
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrable security capabilities
- **Cost Avoidance**: Prevention of breaches and associated costs

## Learning Resources
- **Courses**: SANS SEC540 (Cloud Security), AWS Security Specialty
- **Documentation**: OWASP, NIST, CIS Benchmarks
- **Labs**: Practical implementations in the security labs directory
- **Projects**: Security automation in the [projects/security-automation](../../projects/security-automation) directory

## Certification Path
- AWS Security Specialty (future)
- Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (future)

## Implementation Plan
The detailed implementation plan is available in the [learning-plan.md](learning-plan.md) file, which outlines the day-by-day learning path.

## Financial Services Security Focus
Special focus areas for financial services:
- **Data Protection**: Protecting sensitive financial information
- **Transaction Security**: Ensuring integrity of financial transactions
- **Fraud Prevention**: Security controls to prevent fraud
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting specific financial industry requirements
- **Third-Party Risk**: Managing security of integrated systems
- **Insider Threat**: Preventing and detecting malicious insider activity
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for financial transactions

## Study Notes
Detailed notes on key security concepts are organized in topic-specific directories.
