# Terraform Learning Path for Financial Services

## Overview
This directory documents my journey learning HashiCorp Terraform with a focus on infrastructure as code for DevOps/SRE roles in financial services environments.

## Learning Philosophy
> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This learning path follows a structured approach:
- Begin with core Terraform concepts and syntax
- Develop skills through practical implementation
- Progress to advanced topics and enterprise patterns
- Apply financial services security and compliance requirements
- Demonstrate business value and ROI metrics

## Terraform Topics Covered

### Foundation
- **Core Concepts**: Resources, providers, state, variables, outputs
- **Configuration Language**: HCL syntax, expressions, functions
- **Backend Configuration**: State management and locking
- **Provider Usage**: AWS, Azure, GCP, and other providers
- **Resource Management**: Creating, modifying, and destroying resources

### Intermediate Skills
- **Module Development**: Creating reusable modules
- **State Management**: Remote state, workspaces, import/export
- **Variable Management**: Variable types, validation, defaults
- **Functions and Expressions**: Complex expressions and built-in functions
- **Testing**: Validation, plan analysis, automated testing

### Advanced Topics
- **CI/CD Integration**: Terraform in automated pipelines
- **Policy as Code**: Using Sentinel for governance
- **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise**: Team workflows and governance
- **Large-Scale Management**: Managing multiple environments
- **State Operations**: Advanced state manipulation and migration

### Financial Services Patterns
- **Compliance Controls**: Implementing regulatory requirements
- **Security Implementation**: Defense-in-depth with Terraform
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated architecture documentation
- **Drift Detection**: Identifying unauthorized changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource tagging and cost allocation
- **Scalable Architectures**: Multi-account, multi-region deployments
- **Compliance-as-Code**: Automated validation and remediation

## Business Impact
This learning path emphasizes demonstrating business value through:
- **Deployment Consistency**: Reduced configuration drift and errors
- **Audit Readiness**: Automated documentation and compliance evidence
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced provisioning time for new environments
- **Cost Control**: Automated tagging and resource optimization
- **Security Posture**: Consistent security control implementation
- **Developer Enablement**: Self-service infrastructure with guardrails
- **Change Management**: Improved visibility and control of infrastructure changes

## Learning Resources
- **Courses**: HashiCorp Learn Platform, A Cloud Guru Terraform courses
- **Documentation**: Terraform documentation, AWS with Terraform guides
- **Labs**: Practical implementations in the [labs/terraform-labs](../../labs/terraform-labs) directory
- **Projects**: Real-world applications in the [projects](../../projects) directory

## Certification Path
- [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](../../certifications/terraform-associate)

## Implementation Plan
The detailed implementation plan is available in the [learning-plan.md](learning-plan.md) file, which outlines the day-by-day learning path.

## Study Notes
Detailed notes on key Terraform concepts are organized in topic-specific directories.

## Acknowledgements
This learning path was developed with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, which helped with documentation writing and organization, while all final implementation decisions and review were performed by Joshua Michael Hall.
