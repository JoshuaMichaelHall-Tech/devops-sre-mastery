# Terraform Learning Path

## Overview
This directory documents my journey learning HashiCorp Terraform with a focus on infrastructure as code for DevOps/SRE roles in financial services environments.

## Learning Philosophy
> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This learning path follows a structured approach:
- Begin with core Terraform concepts and syntax
- Develop skills through practical implementation
- Progress to advanced topics and enterprise patterns
- Apply financial services security and compliance requirements

## Terraform Topics Covered

### Foundation
- **Core Concepts**: Resources, providers, state, variables, outputs
- **Configuration Language**: HCL syntax, expressions, functions
- **Backend Configuration**: State management and locking
- **Provider Usage**: AWS, Azure, GCP, and other providers
- **Resource Management**: Creating, modifying, and destroying resources

### Intermediate Skills
- **Module Development**: Creating reusable modules
- **State Management**: Remote state, workspaces, import/export
- **Variable Management**: Variable types, validation, defaults
- **Functions and Expressions**: Complex expressions and built-in functions
- **Testing**: Validation, plan analysis, automated testing

### Advanced Topics
- **CI/CD Integration**: Terraform in automated pipelines
- **Policy as Code**: Using Sentinel for governance
- **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise**: Team workflows and governance
- **Large-Scale Management**: Managing multiple environments
- **State Operations**: Advanced state manipulation and migration

### Financial Services Patterns
- **Compliance Controls**: Implementing regulatory requirements
- **Security Implementation**: Defense-in-depth with Terraform
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated architecture documentation
- **Drift Detection**: Identifying unauthorized changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource tagging and cost allocation

## Learning Resources
- **Courses**: HashiCorp Learn Platform, A Cloud Guru Terraform courses
- **Documentation**: Terraform documentation, AWS with Terraform guides
- **Labs**: Practical implementations in the [labs/terraform-labs](../../labs/terraform-labs) directory
- **Projects**: Real-world applications in the [projects](../../projects) directory

## Certification Path
- [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](../../certifications/terraform-associate)

## Study Notes
Detailed notes on key Terraform concepts are organized in topic-specific directories.
