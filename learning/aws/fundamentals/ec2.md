# AWS EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It is a fundamental service for running applications and serves as the foundation for many financial services workloads requiring specific compute, memory, storage, and networking capabilities.

## Core Components

- **Instances**: Virtual servers with varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking
- **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**: Templates for instances with pre-configured operating systems and applications
- **Instance Types**: Different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities
- **Instance Purchasing Options**: On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Dedicated
- **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent block storage for instances
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls controlling traffic to instances
- **Key Pairs**: Secure login information for instances
- **Elastic IP Addresses**: Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing

## Key Concepts

1. **Elasticity**: Scale compute capacity up and down based on demand
2. **High Availability**: Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
3. **Security**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Integration**: Works with other AWS services for complete solutions

## Implementation Examples

### Financial Services Workload Instance Selection

```
High-Performance Financial Analysis:
- Instance Type: c5.4xlarge (compute optimized)
- vCPUs: 16
- Memory: 32 GiB
- Network Performance: Up to 10 Gbps
- Use Case: Risk modeling, portfolio analysis

Secure Database Server:
- Instance Type: r5.2xlarge (memory optimized)
- vCPUs: 8
- Memory: 64 GiB
- Network Performance: Up to 10 Gbps
- Use Case: In-memory databases, real-time transaction processing

Trading Platform:
- Instance Type: z1d.3xlarge (high frequency CPU)
- vCPUs: 12
- Memory: 96 GiB
- Network Performance: Up to 10 Gbps
- Use Case: Low-latency trading applications
```

### Security Configuration

```bash
# Create security group for a financial application server
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name FinancialAppSG --description "Security group for financial application servers" --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d

# Add inbound rules for secure access
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-903004f8 --protocol tcp --port 443 --source-group sg-903004f9
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-903004f8 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 10.0.0.0/16

# Launch instance with encrypted EBS volumes
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --instance-type r5.2xlarge \
  --key-name financial-keypair --security-group-ids sg-903004f8 \
  --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e \
  --block-device-mappings "DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=100,VolumeType=gp3,Encrypted=true,KmsKeyId=arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef}"
```

## Best Practices

- **Use instance profiles** instead of storing AWS credentials on instances
- **Enable detailed monitoring** for financial workloads
- **Implement automated patching** through AWS Systems Manager
- **Use encrypted EBS volumes** for all financial data
- **Implement instance backup strategy** with AMIs and snapshots
- **Use placement groups** for high-performance computing needs
- **Implement Auto Scaling** for handling variable workloads
- **Apply instance metadata service version 2 (IMDSv2)** for improved security

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Over/under-provisioned instances | Improper instance sizing | Use CloudWatch metrics to right-size instances |
| High EC2 costs | Using On-Demand for steady workloads | Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads |
| Security vulnerabilities | Missing patches | Implement automated patching with Systems Manager |
| Performance issues | Resource contention | Monitor detailed metrics and adjust instance type |

## Financial Services Considerations

- **Compliance Impact**: EC2 instances must meet regulatory security requirements
- **Security Implications**: Instance hardening is critical for financial workloads
- **Audit Requirements**: Instance activity must be logged and monitored
- **Resilience Requirements**: Financial applications require high availability

## Related Concepts

- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Automatically adjust instance capacity
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Manage EC2 instances at scale
- **Amazon EC2 Image Builder**: Automated image creation, management, and deployment
