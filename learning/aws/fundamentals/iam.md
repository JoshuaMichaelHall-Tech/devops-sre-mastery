# AWS IAM: Identity and Access Management

## Overview

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the foundational security service for controlling access to AWS resources. This service is critical for implementing secure, compliant infrastructure for financial services.

## Core Components

- **Users**: Individual identities for people or services requiring AWS access
- **Groups**: Collections of users with shared permission requirements
- **Roles**: Identities assumed by users, applications, or services temporarily
- **Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions to AWS resources
- **Permission Boundaries**: Limits on maximum permissions a user/role can have

## Key Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions required to perform a task
2. **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of security controls
3. **Separation of Duties**: Divide critical functions among different entities
4. **Just-in-Time Access**: Grant permissions only when needed and for limited time

## Implementation Examples

### Secure User Management

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::financial-reports-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::financial-reports-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "192.168.0.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows read-only access to a financial reports bucket, but only from the corporate network IP range.

### Financial Services Role Example

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
        "dynamodb:Query"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/CustomerTransactions",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalTag/Department": "FinancialAnalysis"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows read-only access to a transactions table, but only for users tagged with the Financial Analysis department.

## Best Practices

- **Use IAM Roles for applications** instead of hardcoded credentials
- **Implement MFA** for all human users, especially privileged accounts
- **Rotate credentials** regularly and automatically
- **Use permission boundaries** to limit maximum privileges
- **Monitor and audit** all IAM activities through CloudTrail
- **Use IAM Access Analyzer** to identify unintended access

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Too permissive policies | Use of wildcards like "*" | Specify exact resources and actions |
| Credential exposure | Hardcoded credentials in code | Use IAM roles and instance profiles |
| Inactive users | Poor offboarding process | Implement automated user lifecycle management |
| Privilege escalation | Inadequate permission boundaries | Implement strict permission boundaries for all users |

## Financial Services Considerations

- **Compliance Impact**: IAM is central to meeting SOX, PCI-DSS, and other regulatory requirements
- **Security Implications**: Proper IAM is the foundation of cloud security posture
- **Audit Requirements**: IAM changes must be logged and available for audit review
- **Segregation of Duties**: Required by financial regulations to prevent fraud

## Related Concepts

- **AWS Organizations**: Multi-account management and security
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Account-level permission guardrails
- **AWS Single Sign-On**: Centralized access management
- **AWS Directory Service**: Integration with existing identity providers

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Add specific examples of IAM policies for financial services use cases
2. Include diagrams showing IAM relationships (users, groups, roles)
3. Add detailed sections on audit requirements for financial services
4. Include specific compliance controls implemented through IAM
5. Add real-world examples from your implementations
