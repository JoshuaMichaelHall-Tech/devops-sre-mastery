# AWS VPC: Virtual Private Cloud

## Overview

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the networking foundation for AWS infrastructure, providing isolated network environments with complete control over IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and security. VPC design is critical for financial services applications that require strict network segmentation and security.

## Core Components

- **VPC**: Logically isolated network with CIDR block (IPv4/IPv6)
- **Subnets**: Subdivisions of VPC CIDR blocks, bound to single AZ
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing between subnets and gateways
- **Internet Gateway**: Enables communication with the internet
- **NAT Gateway/Instance**: Allows outbound internet access for private resources
- **Security Groups**: Stateful instance-level firewall
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless subnet-level firewall
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connections to AWS services
- **Transit Gateway**: Network transit hub for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks

## Key Architecture Patterns

1. **Multi-tier VPC**: Separation of public, private application, and private data tiers
2. **Transit VPC**: Hub and spoke model for connecting multiple VPCs
3. **Isolated VPC**: No internet connectivity for highest security workloads
4. **Hybrid Connectivity**: Extension of on-premises network to AWS

## Implementation Examples

### Financial Services Multi-Tier VPC Design

```
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16

Public Subnets (DMZ):
- 10.0.1.0/24 (us-east-1a)
- 10.0.2.0/24 (us-east-1b)
- 10.0.3.0/24 (us-east-1c)

Private Application Subnets:
- 10.0.11.0/24 (us-east-1a)
- 10.0.12.0/24 (us-east-1b)
- 10.0.13.0/24 (us-east-1c)

Private Data Subnets:
- 10.0.21.0/24 (us-east-1a)
- 10.0.22.0/24 (us-east-1b)
- 10.0.23.0/24 (us-east-1c)
```

### VPC Security Controls Implementation

```
Security Group: Web Tier
- Allow HTTP/HTTPS from Internet
- Allow egress only to App Tier on specific ports

Security Group: App Tier
- Allow ingress only from Web Tier on specific ports
- Allow egress only to Data Tier on specific ports

Security Group: Data Tier
- Allow ingress only from App Tier on database ports
- No outbound internet access

Network ACLs:
- Public Subnets: Block known malicious IPs
- Private Subnets: Allow only necessary protocols
- Data Subnets: Most restrictive, database protocols only
```

## Best Practices

- **Plan IP addressing** carefully to support growth and VPC peering
- **Implement multi-AZ deployments** for high availability
- **Use private subnets** for sensitive workloads like databases
- **Implement security at multiple layers** (NACLs, security groups, host-based)
- **Use VPC Flow Logs** for network traffic analysis and security monitoring
- **Implement VPC endpoints** to keep traffic within AWS network
- **Segment environments** (dev, test, prod) using separate VPCs

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Overlapping CIDR blocks | Poor IP planning | Plan address space across all VPCs and on-premises |
| Cross-AZ data transfer costs | Resources in different AZs | Place related resources in same AZ when possible |
| Security group sprawl | Ad-hoc security configuration | Implement security group strategy and naming convention |
| Routing complexity | Complex network architecture | Use Transit Gateway for hub-and-spoke model |

## Financial Services Considerations

- **Compliance Impact**: Network segmentation is critical for PCI-DSS, SOX compliance
- **Security Implications**: Network controls are first line of defense for financial data
- **Audit Requirements**: Network traffic must be logged and auditable
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Some regulations require specific network isolation patterns

## Related Concepts

- **AWS Transit Gateway**: Connect VPCs and on-premises networks
- **AWS PrivateLink**: Private connectivity to services
- **AWS Direct Connect**: Dedicated network connection to AWS
- **AWS Network Firewall**: Managed network firewall service
