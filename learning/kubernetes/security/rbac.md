# Kubernetes RBAC: Role-Based Access Control

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users. In Kubernetes, RBAC is essential for implementing the principle of least privilege, especially in financial services environments where strict access controls are required by regulations.

## Core Components

- **Role**: Defines permissions within a specific namespace
- **ClusterRole**: Defines permissions across the entire cluster
- **RoleBinding**: Grants the permissions defined in a Role to users
- **ClusterRoleBinding**: Grants the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to users
- **ServiceAccount**: An identity for processes running in pods

## Key Concepts

1. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions needed to perform a task
2. **Separation of Duties**: Divide responsibilities among different roles
3. **Namespace Isolation**: Contain permissions within specific namespaces
4. **Audit Trail**: Record and monitor access to resources

## Implementation Examples

### Role for Financial Application Developer

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: financial-app
  name: financial-developer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services", "configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["jobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

### Role Binding for Financial Developer

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: financial-developer-binding
  namespace: financial-app
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: financial-developers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: financial-developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### Cluster Role for Security Auditor

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: security-auditor
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services", "namespaces"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "statefulsets", "daemonsets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["networkpolicies"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["roles", "rolebindings", "clusterroles", "clusterrolebindings"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

## Best Practices

- **Use namespaces** to isolate different applications and teams
- **Apply the principle of least privilege** when defining roles
- **Use service accounts** for pod-level access control
- **Regularly audit RBAC configurations** to detect excessive permissions
- **Document roles and responsibilities** for compliance purposes
- **Use Groups rather than individual Users** for easier management
- **Implement processes for access request and approval**
- **Rotate service account tokens** periodically

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Permission errors | Insufficient permissions | Audit required permissions and update roles |
| Privilege escalation | Overly permissive roles | Implement regular RBAC reviews |
| Complex RBAC structure | Ad-hoc role creation | Design RBAC architecture in advance |
| Access management overhead | Direct user management | Use groups and integration with identity providers |

## Financial Services Considerations

- **Compliance Impact**: RBAC is essential for meeting regulatory requirements for access control
- **Security Implications**: Proper RBAC prevents unauthorized access to sensitive financial data
- **Audit Requirements**: All permissions changes must be logged and reviewable
- **Segregation of Duties**: Financial regulations often require separation of responsibilities

## Related Concepts

- **Pod Security Policies**: Define security constraints for pods
- **Network Policies**: Control network traffic between pods
- **Authentication Methods**: Integration with external identity providers
- **Admission Controllers**: Enforce security policies during resource creation
