# Kubernetes Learning Path for Financial Services

## Overview
This directory documents my journey learning Kubernetes with a focus on container orchestration for DevOps/SRE roles in financial services environments.

## Learning Philosophy
> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This learning path follows a structured approach:
- Begin with core Kubernetes concepts and architecture
- Build foundational skills with hands-on practice
- Progress to advanced topics and financial services patterns
- Document implementation patterns and best practices
- Demonstrate business impact and ROI metrics

## Kubernetes Topics Covered

### Core Concepts
- **Architecture**: Components and control plane
- **Workloads**: Pods, deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets
- **Services & Networking**: Service types, ingress, network policies
- **Configuration**: ConfigMaps, secrets, resource management
- **Storage**: Volumes, persistent volumes, storage classes

### Security & Access Control
- **Authentication**: Service accounts, OIDC integration
- **Authorization**: RBAC configuration for financial services
- **Pod Security**: Security contexts, pod security standards
- **Network Security**: Network policies, service mesh integration
- **Supply Chain Security**: Image scanning, admission controllers

### Advanced Topics
- **Operators**: Extending Kubernetes for stateful applications
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for financial microservices
- **Multi-cluster Management**: Federation and fleet management
- **Compliance Automation**: Policy engines (OPA, Kyverno)
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and tracing

### Financial Services Patterns
- **High Availability**: Resilient cluster architectures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region strategies
- **Compliance Controls**: Implementing regulatory requirements
- **Security Hardening**: Financial-grade security implementations
- **Performance Optimization**: Tuning for financial workloads
- **Scalability**: Handling peak trading volumes
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for compliance

## Business Impact
This learning path emphasizes demonstrating business value through:
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated deployment and management
- **Release Velocity**: Faster, more reliable application deployments
- **Resilience**: Improved uptime and reduced MTTR
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimized cluster usage and cost savings
- **Security Posture**: Quantifiable security improvements
- **Compliance Automation**: Reduced audit preparation time
- **Developer Productivity**: Standardized deployment patterns

## Learning Resources
- **Courses**: KodeKloud CKA, CKS courses
- **Documentation**: Kubernetes.io, CNCF resources
- **Labs**: Practical implementations in the [labs/kubernetes-labs](../../labs/kubernetes-labs) directory
- **Projects**: Real-world applications in the [projects](../../projects) directory

## Certification Path
- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](../../certifications/cka)
- Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) (future)

## Implementation Plan
The detailed implementation plan is available in the [learning-plan.md](learning-plan.md) file, which outlines the day-by-day learning path.

## Study Notes
Detailed notes on key Kubernetes concepts are organized in topic-specific directories.

## Acknowledgements
This learning path was developed with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, which helped with documentation writing and organization, while all final implementation decisions and review were performed by Joshua Michael Hall.
