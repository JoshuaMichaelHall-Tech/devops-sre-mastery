# Repository Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the maintenance process for this public DevOps/SRE learning repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

1. **Learning Resource**: A comprehensive collection of DevOps and SRE learning materials
2. **Project Showcase**: Demonstration of practical implementation skills
3. **Certification Guide**: Documentation of certification preparation approaches
4. **Career Development**: General guidance on DevOps career progression

## Content Organization

The repository is organized around these key principles:

1. **Skill Progression**: Content follows a logical skill development path
2. **Project-Based Learning**: Practical application through real-world projects
3. **Certification Alignment**: Learning resources aligned with industry certifications
4. **Professional Development**: General career guidance and networking approaches

## Synchronization System

This repository maintains synchronized content with private learning repositories through a structured process:

### Synchronized Files

| This Repository | Source | Description | Sync Frequency |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `learning-roadmap.md` | Private planning | High-level roadmap without personal timelines | Weekly |
| `certification-path.md` | Private certification plan | Certification strategy without personal details | Monthly |
| `professional-networking.md` | Private networking strategy | General networking approach without contacts | Monthly |
| `career-learning-plan.md` | Private learning plan | Technical aspects of career learning plan | Monthly |

### Synchronization Process

The synchronization follows this workflow:

1. **Source Update**: Content is updated in the source (private) repository
2. **Sanitization**: Personal details, timelines, and sensitive information are removed
3. **Format Standardization**: Content is formatted for public consumption
4. **Consistency Check**: Content is checked for alignment with rest of the public repository
5. **Commit & Push**: Sanitized content is committed to this repository

### Automated Synchronization

A script (`scripts/sync-repos.sh`) manages the synchronization with these features:

1. **Selective Sync**: Only synchronizes specific files that are meant to be public
2. **Content Filtering**: Automatically removes personal details using pattern matching
3. **Audit Trail**: Logs all synchronization activities for review
4. **Failure Handling**: Detects and reports synchronization errors
