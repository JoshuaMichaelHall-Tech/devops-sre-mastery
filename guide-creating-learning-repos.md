markdown# [Technology] Learning Path

A structured learning repository documenting my journey to master [Technology] for DevOps/SRE roles in financial services environments.

## Learning Philosophy

> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This repository follows a mastery-based learning approach:
- Focus on fundamentals before advanced concepts
- Build real-world projects that demonstrate actual business value
- Document learning for reinforced understanding
- Emphasize financial services applicability

## Learning Progression

   - Integration with other tools
   - Best practices and standards

3. **Advanced Implementation (Week 5-6)**
   - Complex architectures
   - Financial services specific patterns
   - High availability and security considerations

4. **Mastery Projects (Week 7-8)**
   - Enterprise-grade implementations
   - Compliance and regulatory considerations
   - Performance optimization and scaling

## Projects
