# DevOps/SRE Certification Strategy for Financial Services

## Strategic Certification Approach

This certification strategy is designed to build technical credibility and expertise in DevOps/SRE roles for financial services environments. The approach prioritizes certifications that provide the greatest business impact and validate skills that financial institutions value most.

## Core Principles

- **Business Value First**: Prioritize certifications that demonstrate skills with clear business impact
- **Depth Over Breadth**: Build deep expertise in strategic domains rather than surface-level knowledge across many areas
- **Practical Application**: Focus on certifications that validate practical skills, not just theoretical knowledge
- **Financial Services Relevance**: Emphasize security, compliance, and high availability capabilities
- **Strategic Sequencing**: Follow a structured progression that builds on previous knowledge

   - Build hands-on skills through labs and practice environments

2. **Application Phase**
   - Apply knowledge in portfolio projects
   - Document implementations that demonstrate certification-relevant skills
   - Create architectural diagrams and decision documentation

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Take practice exams until consistently scoring >85%
   - Review weak areas with focused study
   - Schedule and complete certification exam

## ROI Measurement

For each certification, track these business impact metrics:
- **Skill Application**: How certification knowledge is applied in portfolio projects
- **Efficiency Gains**: Time/cost savings from implemented best practices
