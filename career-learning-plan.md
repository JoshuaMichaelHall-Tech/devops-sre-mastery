2. **Architecture Diagrams** - Visual representation of system design
3. **Implementation Guides** - Step-by-step instructions for recreating your work
4. **Technical Articles** - Knowledge sharing through blog posts and documentation

### Learning Resource Types

Combine different learning resources for comprehensive understanding:

1. **Official Documentation** - Primary source of accurate information
2. **Hands-On Courses** - Structured guidance for practical implementation
3. **Books** - Deep conceptual understanding and best practices
4. **Community Resources** - Real-world implementations and problem-solving
5. **Practice Environments** - Safe spaces to experiment and learn

## Certification Integration

Certifications serve as structured learning paths and validation of knowledge:

1. **Cloud Foundations** - AWS/Azure/GCP associate-level certifications
2. **Specialization** - Terraform, Kubernetes, and security certifications
3. **Advanced Expertise** - Professional and specialty certifications

Refer to the [Certification Path](./certification-path.md) for a detailed progression.

## Project Portfolio Development

Build a comprehensive project portfolio that demonstrates practical capabilities:
