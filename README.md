# DevOps/SRE Mastery for Financial Services

A repository documenting my journey to master DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering skills, with a strategic focus on AWS specialization, Infrastructure as Code, and container orchestration for financial services environments.

## Strategic Philosophy

> "Deep expertise in a few critical areas creates more value than shallow knowledge across many."

This repository implements a specialized, high-ROI approach to DevOps/SRE mastery:
- Strategic specialization in AWS for financial services rather than multi-cloud
- Depth over breadth in technical skills with measurable business impact
- Security and compliance-first approach for regulated environments
- Project implementations that demonstrate quantifiable business value
- Clear progression path toward principal/staff engineer level expertise

## Repository Purpose
