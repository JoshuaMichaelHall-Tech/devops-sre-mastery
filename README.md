# DevOps/SRE Mastery

A repository documenting my journey to master DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering skills, showcasing projects, learning resources, and certification preparation for financial services environments.

## Philosophy

> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This repository follows a mastery-based learning approach:
- Focus on fundamentals before advanced concepts
- Build real-world projects that demonstrate actual business value
- Emphasize automation, security, and reliability
- Document the learning journey to reinforce understanding
- Apply DevOps practices to financial services environments

## Repository Purpose

This is a public technical repository focused specifically on:

1. **Technical Learning Content**: Documentation of my DevOps/SRE learning journey
2. **Project Implementations**: Code and configurations for real-world DevOps projects
3. **Certification Resources**: Study notes and practical exercises for certifications
4. **Lab Environments**: Hands-on practice setups for different technologies
5. **Best Practices**: Documentation of DevOps patterns and practices

This repository is intentionally focused on technical content and project implementations, without personal career details or timelines.
