# DevOps/SRE Mastery

A repository documenting my journey to master DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering skills, showcasing projects, learning resources, and certification preparation for financial services environments.

## Philosophy

> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

This repository follows a mastery-based learning approach:
- Focus on fundamentals before advanced concepts
- Build real-world projects that demonstrate actual business value
- Emphasize automation, security, and reliability
- Document the learning journey to reinforce understanding
- Apply DevOps practices to financial services environments

## Featured Projects

### 1. Infrastructure Multi-Environment

A comprehensive Infrastructure as Code implementation for deploying and managing multi-environment infrastructure (dev/test/prod) using Terraform and AWS. Focuses on security, compliance, and scalability for financial services workloads.

**Key Features:**
- Environment isolation with proper security boundaries
- Compliance controls for financial services (SOX, PCI-DSS)
- Complete infrastructure deployed through code
- State management and collaboration approaches

### 2. Container Platform

A microservices platform implementation using Docker and Kubernetes with comprehensive monitoring, security, and deployment pipeline. Designed for financial services applications requiring high reliability and security.

**Key Features:**
- Containerized microservices architecture
- Kubernetes cluster with proper RBAC configuration
- Monitoring and observability implementation
- Security scanning integration

### 3. Security Automation

A suite of security automation tools for continuous compliance monitoring, security scanning, and remediation in financial services environments. Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for proactive security.

**Key Features:**
- Infrastructure security scanning
- Container vulnerability management
- Compliance reporting for financial regulations
- Secret management and rotation

## Career Path

This repository documents a progression from foundational DevOps skills to specialized financial services platform engineering:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure, containerization, and automation fundamentals
2. **Specialist Phase**: Advanced cloud architecture, Kubernetes operations, CI/CD
3. **Financial Services Focus**: Compliance automation, security engineering, platform development
